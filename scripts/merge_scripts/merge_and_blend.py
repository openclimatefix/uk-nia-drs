"""
This script is designed to merge and blend forecast data from two different models, XGBoost (XG) and PVNet, 
to create a combined forecast dataset. The blending process is optional and can be controlled through a parameter. 
The script performs several key operations:

- It first converts the 'Init Time' column in both datasets to datetime format, ensuring that the data is aligned 
  on the same temporal scale for accurate merging.
- The data from both models is then merged based on the 'Init Time' column. This operation combines the forecasts 
  from both models into a single dataset, with PVNet's forecasts being appended as new columns with a suffix to 
  distinguish them from XGBoost's forecasts.
- If blending is enabled, the script calculates blended forecasts for specific forecast horizons based on predefined 
  blending ratios. These ratios determine the weight of each model's forecast in the final blended output.
- For columns present in both datasets (excluding 'Init Time'), the script either blends the forecasts (if blending 
  is enabled and the column is eligible for blending) or replaces XGBoost's forecasts with PVNet's forecasts.
- The combined dataset is then filtered to include only data points starting from January 1, 2020, up to August 8, 2022.
- A copy of the combined dataset is created to adjust the '0 Hour Forecast' by using PVNet's '0.5 Hour Forecast' for 
  the next initiation time, compensating for XGBoost's lack of a '0 Hour Forecast'.
- The script also prepares a separate dataset containing XGBoost's forecasts prior to January 1, 2020.
- Finally, the pre-2020 XGBoost dataset and the adjusted combined dataset are concatenated to form the final merged 
  and blended dataset, which is then returned.
